    <p>Hello, I am a game developer exploring coding and 2D/3D game development. I mainly create 2D games but am trying to expand my skills.</p>

    <div class="game">
        <img src="Dress up Game.png" alt="Dress Up Game">
        <p>This game lets you dress up the player with clothes inside the game. All the assets, including the fonts, were made by me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game">
        <img src="Yaya Baking.png" alt="Yaya Baking Game">
        <p>This is a baking game with a mythical creature. Again, I made everything, including the fonts.</p>
